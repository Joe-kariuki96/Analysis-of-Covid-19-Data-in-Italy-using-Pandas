# Title: Analysis of Covid-19 Data in Italy using Pandas

## Introduction:

The analysis looks at Covid-19 data in Italy from Dec 2019 to Sep 2020 using Pandas.
The data contains daily counts for new cases, deaths, and tests.
## Key Findings:

The total reported cases in Italy during this period were 271,960 and total reported deaths were 35,497.

The overall reported death rate was 13.07%.

5.21% of tests resulted in a positive diagnosis.

More cases tended to be reported on Sundays compared to other days.

Daily deaths hit a peak around a week after the peak in daily new cases.

The highest number of cases were reported in the last two weeks of March.

By merging with population data, metrics like cases per million (4,498), deaths per million (587), and tests per million (86,249) were calculated.

The death rate and positive test rate have decreased over time.

## Conclusion
Pandas provided an effective way to import, clean, analyze and visualize the Covid-19 data.

Useful insights were obtained into the progression of the pandemic in Italy over time.

Further analysis could examine the data on a regional basis.
